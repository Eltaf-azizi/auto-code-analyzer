Analyze source code from any GitHub repository using the power of AI.

This project demonstrates how to build an AI-powered code analyzer that can read and understand source code from GitHub repositories. By combining Python, OpenAI, LangChain, and vector databases like ChromaDB, the system creates a smart knowledge base of code that can be queried conversationally.



## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **GitHub Integration** – Fetch and analyze any public repository.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Code Understanding** – Use OpenAI's models to generate insights and explanations.
- 📚 **Knowledge Base Creation** – Store code context using vector embeddings.
- 💬 **Conversational Interface** – Interact with your code via natural language.
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** – Easily deploy your solution to the cloud.
